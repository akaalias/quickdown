### Markdown Template with Directives
Create better notes faster with a custom markdown template without having leave your keyboard.

- Directives are **super useful** when you want to have a solid boilerplate for all your notes but STILL want to start writing right away
- You can now create **complex Markdown templates** AND **place your cursor** exactly where you want to start writing

#### Available Directives
1. Your cursor position on focus (%CURSOR%)
2. Today's date and time (%DATETIME%)
3. Just today's date (%DATE%)
4. Just the time (%TIME%)
5. Your clipboard content (%CLIPBOARD%)

## Insert directives in your template

### Project Background

As an [avid Obsidian user](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau) and [constant pen-paper note-taker](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+My+Physical+Notebooks+(Photos)), I often want to take a quick markdown note while working 
- _without_ having to keep Obsidian running in the background
- _without_ having to switch to Obsidian to write
- _without_ having to leave my keyboard

To me, I want to "catch" notes _all the time_, while I want to connect and remix them in Obsidian only at specific moments. 

None of the existing [note-taking menu bar apps](https://www.macmenubar.com/note-taking-apps/) had what I needed. So I made my own that fits my needs perfectly.

1. A single global hotkey `⌘-⌥-N` opens the note popover
2. A simple `⌘-S` saves the note into my Obsidian vault
3. A simple `Esc` dismisses the popover

Just a way to jot down a markdown note.

Nothing more, nothing less.
