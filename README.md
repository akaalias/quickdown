### Background

As an [avid Obsidian user](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau), I often want to take a quick note while working 
- _without_ having to keep Obsidian running in the background
- _without_ having to switch to Obsidian to write
- _without_ having to leave my keyboard

To me, I want to "catch" notes _all the time_, while I want to connect and remix them in Obsidian only at specific moments. 

None of the quick note menu bar apps on the App Store were keyboard-first, so I made my own that fits my needs perfectly.

1. A single global hotkey `⌘-⌥-N` opens the note popover
2. A simple `⌘-S` saves the note into my Obsidian vault
3. A simple `Esc` dismisses the popover

Just a way to jot down a markdown note.

Nothing more, nothing less.
