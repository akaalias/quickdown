## QuickDown: Keyboard-first, local markdown note-taking for MacOS

![Demo](https://github.com/akaalias/quickdown/blob/main/demo.gif?raw=true)
 
### Hotkeys
- Global Hotkey: **⌘-⌥-N**
- Save Markdown Note (Local and iCloud): **⌘-S**
- Open Markdown Note (Local and iCloud): **⌘-O**

### Markdown Template WITH Custom Cursor Placement
- **Super useful** when you want to have a solid boilerplate for all your notes but STILL want to start writing right away
- You can now create complex Markdown templates and still place your cursor exactly where you want to start writing
- Simply use `%CURSOR%` to tell QuickDown where to place your cursor on focus:

### Project Background

As an [avid Obsidian user](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau) and [constant pen-paper note-taker](https://publish.obsidian.md/alexisrondeau/%E2%AD%90%EF%B8%8F+My+Physical+Notebooks+(Photos)), I often want to take a quick markdown note while working 
- _without_ having to keep Obsidian running in the background
- _without_ having to switch to Obsidian to write
- _without_ having to leave my keyboard

To me, I want to "catch" notes _all the time_, while I want to connect and remix them in Obsidian only at specific moments. 

None of the existing [note-taking menu bar apps](https://www.macmenubar.com/note-taking-apps/) had what I needed. So I made my own that fits my needs perfectly.

1. A single global hotkey `⌘-⌥-N` opens the note popover
2. A simple `⌘-S` saves the note into my Obsidian vault
3. A simple `Esc` dismisses the popover

Just a way to jot down a markdown note.

Nothing more, nothing less.
